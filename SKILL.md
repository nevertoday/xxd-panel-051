description: "Create XXD Panel 051 artwork from supplied photos in four combinable modes: photo above/handcrafted miniature 3D paper-craft scene on a narrow floating landscape band below, photo left/design right, design alone, or a four-device wallpaper pack with independent or anchor-linked continuity. Use for the exact 051 style; reject plastic CGI, toy-display styling, childish craft, generic diorama, thick or bulky base, meaningless prop piles, excessive cuteness, e-commerce staging, dirty colour, flat vector substitution, and missing handmade material evidence."

# XXD Panel 051 · 空气蓝横向微缩纸艺景观

Rebuild the source as a refined handcrafted miniature 3D paper-craft installation: one unmistakable central subject, a narrow airy horizontal landscape band, a few source-grounded supporting models, true paper/card/clay/wood material evidence, macro-photographic light, and abundant pale-paper breathing room.

Operational rules follow the shared XXD Panel workflow contract: four combinable modes; source-adaptive ordinary canvases; exact 50/50 paired geometry; linked or independent four-device wallpapers; copy and locale preflight; fresh generation jobs; privacy-preserving raster generation; and one fresh task directory per source and mode. Style-specific sections refine aesthetics and copy but never override this contract.

## Non-negotiable contract

- One source may use one or more selected modes. Each selected ordinary mode (`top-bottom`, `left-right`, `design-only`) produces one PNG; `wallpaper-pack` produces four separate PNGs. Selecting all four modes produces seven final files per source. Never combine them into a grid, contact sheet, overview, or mockup.
- Resolve a non-empty ordered set of modes. Accept one choice, multiple choices separated by `+`, Chinese/English commas or whitespace, natural-language names, or `全部` / `all`; deduplicate and execute in menu order 1→4.
- If `wallpaper-pack` is selected, resolve `linked` or `independent`. A linked pack approves one iPad anchor by default, then every other device references the original source plus that same anchor. An independent pack gives every device only the original. Never crop one wallpaper into another and never chain derivatives.
- Paired modes split exactly 50/50. `design-only` and every wallpaper show no source photo, seam, or reserved photographic panel.
- Exact user pixels win, then explicit ratio/destination. Otherwise adapt losslessly: `top-bottom` = `W×2H`, `left-right` = `2W×H`, `design-only` = `W×H`. The archived 3:4 canvas is not a silent default.
- Keep visible photography faithful: restrained editorial grading and necessary environmental extension only; never stretch, distort, repaint, replace, or structurally alter the source.
- Preserve at least three source-specific identity, silhouette, proportion, pose, direction, structure, function, colour, distance, or narrative-relation cues in every transformed frame.
- Copy has no silent default. Before generation resolve `自动文案`, `自定义文案`, or `无文字`; automatic and custom modes also require target language or locale. Preserve exact user copy verbatim.
- Render no logo, watermark, signature, colour swatch, UI, device mockup, decorative pseudo-text, or unrelated prose.

## Aesthetic motive lock

Every transformed frame must visibly follow this source-bound chain:

**lock subject, silhouette, pose, and narrative relation → preserve three source-specific cues → rebuild one recognisable handmade miniature → derive only necessary supporting models → organise everything on one narrow horizontal floating landscape band → expose paper fibre, folds, cuts, layered thickness, and tiny imperfections → use soft macro light and delicate contact shadows → preserve a vast pale-paper field → integrate copy like a small maker's signature**.

Reject the result as generic if an unrelated photograph could replace the source without materially changing recognition, model construction, material choices, landscape-band rhythm, palette relation, or copy. The operative exclusions are: plastic CGI, toy-model display, childish classroom craft, generic diorama, thick bulky plinth, meaningless prop pile, excessive cuteness, e-commerce staging, flat-vector substitution, smooth synthetic surfaces, dirty or yellowed colour, and missing handmade evidence.

## 051 visual system

- Preserve at least three source-specific cues across identity, silhouette, proportion, pose, axis, action, structure, function, distance, or relation. The central miniature must be recognisable at first glance rather than a generic object of the same category.
- Build one core subject on one narrow, lightweight, horizontally extended floating landscape base. Adjust height, front-back depth, density, and left-right balance to the source; centred does not mean rigidly symmetrical.
- Translate only necessary source-supported elements into paper, card, soft clay, thin wood, or compatible handmade materials. Plants, roads, water, lamps, vehicles, people, birds, or clouds remain smaller and lower-weight narrative support, never an inventory of props.
- Establish depth through scale change, layered occlusion, and small foreground/background models while retaining abundant clean whitespace. The base must feel like a carefully displayed miniature art installation, not a thick platform or complete toy world.
- Make paper fibre, folded edges, cut edges, layered thickness, slight fuzz, tiny joins, and subtle making imperfections visible. Use soft natural diffuse light and delicate contact shadows for believable volume and macro-photographic tactility; avoid synthetic smoothness.
- Lead with powder blue, mist blue, sky blue, and airy cool blue; balance with ivory, cream, pale beige, soft grey-green, sage, and architectural neutrals. Dusty rose or muted blush is a tiny accent. Keep colour soft yet clean, never muddy, yellowed, or candy-like.

## Copy belongs to the image language

Automatic copy must infer one short title from the source's actual place, subject identity, theme, emotion, deeper meaning, or hidden relation; it is not restricted to a city name. Use the resolved target language even though the archived brief historically mentioned English. Set small, refined, lightly handwritten native type, preferably beneath the landscape band or gently following its curve or base edge. Keep it sparse and elegant, like a maker's signature rather than a commercial headline; never add long explanatory copy.

Copy must pass the unrelated-image swap test. Preserve exact supplied wording verbatim; refine only an explicitly editable direction while protecting audience, purpose, mandatory words, tone, implication, and semantic line breaks.

Resolve locale independently from command language:

```text
target market or audience > requested output language > direction language; if none is explicit, ask before generation
```

Use native wording, rhetoric, punctuation, spacing, shaping, direction, and line breaks. Never infer nationality or audience language from appearance, clothing, scenery, filenames, metadata, or signs.

## Raster generation and privacy

Use the host's built-in bitmap generation capability by default and follow the available `imagegen` skill when exposed. Use one generation call per distinct asset; a wallpaper pack needs four. Style language describes raster appearance only and never authorises SVG, HTML, CSS, Canvas, 3D code, diagrams, or programmatic drawing as the artwork.

If built-in generation is unavailable, use the bundled privacy-safe configured route:

```bash
python3 scripts/configured_imagegen.py probe
python3 scripts/configured_imagegen.py edit --image source.png \
  --prompt-file /private/job-temp/transform-prompt.txt \
  --out /private/job-temp/design.png --size 1536x1024 --quality high
```

Judge readiness by actual bitmap capability, not a provider name or a single environment variable. Never display, log, persist, or report providers, endpoints, headers, credentials, account identifiers, route configuration, prompts, responses, or secrets. The bridge's sanitised status is the entire allowed diagnostic surface. An explicit invocation with source and desired output authorises any already configured authenticated bitmap route available to the session; do not request another confirmation solely because the route changes.

Only report generation unavailable after built-in bitmap capability and the bundled sanitised probe both fail. State the limitation narrowly, never guess its cause, and never substitute code-rendered art.

## Fresh-task and source boundary

Every invocation starts a fresh job unless the user explicitly asks to continue, audit, compare, edit, or reuse a named result. Repeating the same source and settings still requires fresh generation. An old file can never satisfy a new request.

Use only current attachments, explicit paths, or a previously supplied image clearly identified by the user. Never scan Desktop, `~/Desktop/xxd/xxd-panel-051/`, or historical task folders for a substitute.

## Workflow

1. If mode is unresolved, ask in normal multiline text and wait:

   ```text
   请选择一个或多个模式（回复序号；多选可用 +、顿号或逗号）：

   1. 上下双联（完整原图＋同尺寸设计图）
   2. 左右双联（完整原图＋同尺寸设计图）
   3. 纯设计版（沿用原图比例，不显示原照片）
   4. 四端壁纸套装
      手机＋iPad＋电脑＋儿童手表

   前三种不指定尺寸时按原图自适应；也可主动指定尺寸。壁纸可按设备分别给分辨率。
   示例：1｜1+3｜1、2、4｜全部
   ```

2. If wallpaper relationship is unresolved, ask for `1. 连贯套装（原图＋同一批准定调图）` or `2. 四张独立（每张只参考原图）`.
3. Before generation, ask for `1. 自动文案（注明语言／地区）`, `2. 自定义文案（准确文字＋语言／地区）`, or `3. 无文字` when unresolved.
4. Resolve dimensions per mode. For wallpapers ask for labelled custom sizes or the common preset: phone `1440×3200`, iPad `2048×2732`, desktop `3840×2160`, watch `1024×1024`. Exact paired canvases require even split axes; never silently round.
5. View the source and privately lock identity, at least three recognition cues, structure, action, relation, environmental evidence, emotional implication, colour logic, copy payload, and target locale. Do not claim unsupported facts.
6. Create a new collision-safe root under `~/Desktop/xxd/xxd-panel-051/`, then one source folder and sibling mode folders. Never overwrite or use an old output as completion evidence.
7. Read `references/xxd-panel-051-prompt.en.md` or `.zh-CN.md`, append the locked source facts, exact copy payload, `OUTPUT MODE`, `FINAL SIZE`, and `DESIGN FRAME`, then generate each distinct design frame separately.
8. For paired modes, generate only the design panel at the planned half-frame size and compose with `scripts/compose_panel.py`. For design-only and wallpapers, generate the whole canvas without the source photo or a seam.
9. Inspect every result at full size. Correct the asset—not only the prompt—until identity, style, copy, locale, raster format, dimensions, and count pass.

## Output structure

```text
~/Desktop/xxd/xxd-panel-051/<fresh-task>/
└── source-01/
    ├── top-bottom/final.png
    ├── left-right/final.png
    ├── design-only/final.png
    └── wallpaper-pack/phone.png · ipad.png · desktop.png · watch.png
```

Create only selected folders. Return direct PNG paths and a concise count summary. Do not create an automatic combined preview.

## Acceptance gate

- Correct fresh source, selected modes, dimensions, file count, and exact 50/50 paired geometry.
- At least three source-specific recognition cues remain; one core handmade miniature, one narrow horizontal landscape strip, only necessary source-grounded supporting models, and every visual-system requirement above are visible.
- Copy is exact, source-bound, language-native, legible, and structurally integrated; text-free output contains no text or pseudo-text.
- Linked wallpapers share the original source and same approved anchor without derivative chaining; independent wallpapers use only the source.
- Final files are raster PNGs. No SVG/HTML/Canvas/programmatic-art substitute, mockup, overview, UI, watermark, or leaked private route information.

## Override policy

Preserve explicit subject, mode set, output count, exact pixels or ratios, wallpaper relationship, copy mode, exact wording, locale, and intended meaning. User overrides may alter these variables but do not silently authorise abandoning source identity, the 051 aesthetic motive, fresh-task isolation, raster-only output, privacy, or verification. If the user explicitly requests a different aesthetic, acknowledge that it leaves this Skill's style rather than pretending it remains 051.

## References

- Read `references/xxd-panel-051-prompt.en.md` or `references/xxd-panel-051-prompt.zh-CN.md` immediately before generation.
- `references/051-source.md` archives the original style brief and is evidence, not an implicit 3:4 default.
